* CTG_Data_Pre_Processing.ipynb and New_Features.ipynb process data obtained from ClinicalTrial.gov and AACT (a publicly available relational database that contains all information about studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov).
* FDA.ipynb processes the data downloaded from openFDA (an API that serves public FDA data about nouns like drugs, devices, and foods)
* p_value.ipynb process data downloaded from AACT on trial results
* CTG_Supervised Models.ipynb uses all the data generated by the above-listed notebooks, in addition to a dataset of PUBMED-published trials, and trains commonly used machine learning models to predict success/failure of phase 3 clinical trials.
