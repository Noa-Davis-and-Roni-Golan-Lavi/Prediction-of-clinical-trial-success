# Prediction-of-clinical-trial-success
This project uses machine learning to predict Phase 3 clinical trial success. It analyzes public data from ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and the FDA to identify key factors like study size and patient retention that are most predictive of a trial's outcome. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize drug development strategies.
